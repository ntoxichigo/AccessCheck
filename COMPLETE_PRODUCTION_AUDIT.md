## 🔐 SECURITY AUDIT

### ✅ Strengths
- ✅ Clerk authentication (industry-standard)
- ✅ Stripe payment processing (PCI compliant)
- ✅ Database credentials in environment variables
- ✅ API routes protected with auth checks
- ✅ CORS headers configured
- ✅ Rate limiting logic exists
- ✅ Input validation on forms
- ✅ SQL injection protection (Prisma ORM)
- ✅ XSS protection (React escaping)

### ⚠️ Weaknesses
- ⚠️ API keys stored in plain text (should be hashed)
- ⚠️ No request size limits (risk: large CSV uploads)
- ⚠️ No CAPTCHA on contact form (risk: spam)
- ⚠️ Admin routes only check isAdmin flag (no 2FA)
- ⚠️ Webhook signatures validated but no retry logic
- ⚠️ No Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- ⚠️ Session timeout not configured

### 🔧 Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)
1. **Hash API keys** (store hash in DB, show key once) - 2 hours
2. **Add CAPTCHA to contact form** (Cloudflare Turnstile) - 1 hour
3. **Add request size limits** (Next.js config) - 30 minutes
4. **Configure CSP headers** (Next.js middleware) - 1 hour
5. **Add 2FA for admin** (Clerk supports this) - 30 minutes
