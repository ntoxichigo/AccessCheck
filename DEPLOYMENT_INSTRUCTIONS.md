# ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions - Sprint 1 Features

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- Node.js 18+ installed
- PostgreSQL database access
- Resend API account (for emails)
- Access to your `.env.local` file

---

## Step 1: Database Migration

The free trial system requires new database fields.

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd accessibility-checker

# Generate Prisma client with new schema
npx prisma generate

# Push schema changes to database
npx prisma db push

# Verify migration
npx prisma studio
# Check User model has: trialStarted, trialEnds, hadTrial fields
```

**Alternative (if you prefer migrations):**
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_trial_fields
```

---

## Step 2: Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Email Notifications (Required for emails)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Base URL (Required for email links)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Change in production

# Verify these exist:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

### Getting a Resend API Key

1. Go to https://resend.com
2. Sign up for free account
3. Navigate to API Keys
4. Create new API key
5. Copy key to `.env.local`

**Note:** Free tier includes 3,000 emails/month

---

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

No new packages needed! All dependencies already installed:
- `resend` - Already in package.json
- `framer-motion` - Already installed
- All other features use existing packages

But just to be safe:
```bash
npm install
```

---

## Step 4: Test Locally

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Test Each Feature:

**1. Usage Indicators:**
- Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard
- Should see usage widget (e.g., "0/5 scans used")

**2. Upgrade Modal:**
- As free user, use all 5 scans
- Try to scan again â†’ modal should appear

**3. Free Trial:**
- Visit http://localhost:3000/pricing
- Should see purple "Start Free Trial" banner
- Click button â†’ should activate trial

**4. Email Notifications:**
- Complete a scan as authenticated user
- Check email inbox for scan completion email
- Verify link works

**5. Onboarding Tutorial:**
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
- Refresh http://localhost:3000/dashboard
- Tutorial modal should appear

**6. Annual Pricing:**
- Visit http://localhost:3000/pricing
- See Monthly/Annual toggle
- Toggle should show "Save 20%" badge

**7. Exit Survey:**
- Go to http://localhost:3000/settings
- (If Pro user) Click "Cancel Subscription"
- Modal should ask for cancellation reason

---

## Step 5: Production Deployment

### A. Vercel Deployment

```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Sprint 1 - Usage tracking, trials, emails, onboarding"
git push origin main

# Deploy to Vercel (if connected)
vercel --prod
```

### B. Update Environment Variables on Vercel

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add production values:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_live_xxxxx (production key)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```
3. Redeploy if needed

### C. Database Migration on Production

**If using Neon/Supabase:**
```bash
# Set production database URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://prod..."

# Push schema
npx prisma db push
```

**Or via Prisma Cloud:**
- Migrations run automatically on deploy

---

## Step 6: Configure Email Domain (Optional but Recommended)

For professional emails, add custom domain to Resend:

1. Go to Resend Dashboard â†’ Domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., `accesscheck.com`)
3. Add DNS records (MX, TXT, DKIM)
4. Verify domain
5. Update email template in `lib/email-templates.ts`:
   ```typescript
   from: 'AccessCheck <noreply@yourdomain.com>'
   ```

---

## Step 7: Stripe Configuration (For Annual Pricing)

To enable annual billing:

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard â†’ Products
2. Find your Pro product
3. Add new price:
   - **Type:** Recurring
   - **Interval:** Year
   - **Amount:** $144.00
4. Copy Price ID (e.g., `price_1ABC123...`)
5. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRO_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID=price_1ABC123...
   ```

6. Update checkout logic in `app/api/billing/create-checkout-session.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const priceId = billingInterval === 'annual'
     ? process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRO_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID
     : process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID;
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Database migration fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check database connection
npx prisma studio

# Force push (caution: production)
npx prisma db push --force-reset  # Only in dev!

# Or create migration
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only
# Review SQL, then:
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Issue: Emails not sending

**Check:**
1. `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. API key is production key (not test)
3. From email domain is verified
4. Check Resend dashboard for errors
5. User has `emailPrefs` not disabled

**Debug:**
```typescript
// Add logging to scan route
console.log('Sending email to:', user.emailAddresses[0].emailAddress);
```

### Issue: Trial not starting

**Check:**
1. User not already Pro
2. User hasn't had trial before
3. Database fields exist (`trialStarted`, etc.)
4. API endpoint returns success

**Test:**
```bash
# Check user in database
npx prisma studio
# Look for trialStarted, trialEnds, hadTrial
```

### Issue: Onboarding not showing

**Check:**
1. LocalStorage key: `accesscheck_tutorial_seen`
2. Clear it: `localStorage.removeItem('accesscheck_tutorial_seen')`
3. Refresh dashboard
4. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Usage indicator not updating

**Check:**
1. `/api/usage` endpoint works
2. Database has scan records
3. User ID matches
4. React state updating (check DevTools)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur in production:

### Quick Rollback:

```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
vercel rollback
```

### Database Rollback:

```bash
# If migration issues, revert schema
# (Only if you created migrations)
npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Feature Flags:

Add to disable specific features:

```typescript
// In components
const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  usageIndicators: true,
  freeTrial: true,
  emailNotifications: true,
  onboarding: true,
};

// Wrap features
{FEATURE_FLAGS.onboarding && <OnboardingTutorial />}
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics to Watch:

1. **Email Delivery Rate:**
   - Check Resend dashboard
   - Target: >95% delivered

2. **API Response Times:**
   - `/api/usage` should be <200ms
   - `/api/trial/start` should be <500ms

3. **Database Queries:**
   - Monitor Prisma queries
   - Add indexes if slow

4. **User Engagement:**
   - Onboarding completion rate
   - Trial start rate
   - Email open rate
