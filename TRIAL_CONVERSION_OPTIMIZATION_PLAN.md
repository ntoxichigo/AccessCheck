# Trial Conversion Optimization Plan 🎯

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Goal:** Prevent "one-and-done" trial abuse while maximizing paid conversions

---

## 🚨 Problem Identified

**Current Issue:** Trial users can:
- Run unlimited scans for 14 days
- Download full PDF reports with all details
- Fix all accessibility issues
- Never upgrade to paid plan
- **Result:** Low trial-to-paid conversion, revenue loss

---

## 💡 Strategic Solution

### Phase 1: Feature Gating Strategy

#### A. PDF Export Restrictions (CRITICAL)
**Current State:** Full PDF export available during trial  
**New Strategy:**

1. **Trial Users Get:**
   - ✅ View full scan results in dashboard
   - ✅ See all violations and details online
   - ✅ Preview first 2 pages of PDF report
   - ❌ Download complete PDF (blocked with upgrade prompt)
   - ❌ Print full report (watermarked preview only)

2. **Watermark Implementation:**
   - Add "TRIAL VERSION - Upgrade for Full Report" watermark
   - Limit PDF to summary page + first 5 critical issues
   - Include upgrade CTA on every page of trial PDF

3. **Technical Implementation:**
   ```typescript
   // lib/pdf-export.ts
   function generatePDF(scanResult, userPlan) {
     if (userPlan === 'trial' || userPlan === 'free') {
       return generateWatermarkedPDF(scanResult, {
         watermark: 'TRIAL VERSION',
         maxIssues: 5,
         includeCTA: true
       });
     }
     return generateFullPDF(scanResult);
   }
   ```

#### B. Scan Volume Limits
**Current State:** Unlimited scans during trial  
**New Strategy:**

| Plan | Scan Limits |
|------|-------------|
| **Free** | 5 scans total (lifetime) |
| **Trial** | 10 scans total (14 days) |
| **Pro** | 10 scans/day (unlimited) |

**Reasoning:**
- 10 scans in 14 days = enough to test thoroughly
- Forces prioritization of important pages
- Creates urgency to upgrade for ongoing monitoring

#### C. Feature Access Matrix

| Feature | Free | Trial | Pro |
|---------|------|-------|-----|
| Basic Scans | ✅ (5 total) | ✅ (10 total) | ✅ Unlimited |
| View Results Online | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **PDF Export** | ❌ | **Preview Only** | ✅ Full |
| Email Notifications | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Scan History (30 days) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Scan History (All Time) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Batch Scanning | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Scheduled Scans | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| API Access | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Priority Support | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Custom Branding | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## 📋 Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: PDF Export Gating ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Files to Modify:**
1. `app/api/pdf/route.ts` - Add plan checking
2. `lib/pdf/generatePDFReport.ts` - Add watermark logic
3. `components/ResultsDisplay.tsx` - Show upgrade prompt for export
4. `components/UpgradeModal.tsx` - Add "export" variant

**Implementation Steps:**

```typescript
// Step 1: Check user plan before PDF generation
if (user.subscription === 'free' || isTrialUser(user)) {
  return showUpgradeModal('export');
}

// Step 2: Add watermark to trial PDFs
function addWatermark(doc, page) {
  doc.fontSize(40)
     .fillColor('#cccccc', 0.3)
     .text('TRIAL VERSION', 100, 400, {
       rotate: 45,
       align: 'center'
     });
}

// Step 3: Limit content for trial users
function limitTrialContent(violations) {
  return violations.slice(0, 5); // Only first 5 issues
}
```

**User Experience:**
1. Trial user clicks "Export PDF"
2. Modal appears: "Upgrade to export full reports"
3. Shows preview of what they'll get
4. Clear CTA: "Upgrade to Pro - $15/mo"

---

### Task 2: Scan Volume Tracking

**Files to Modify:**
1. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Add scan counter fields
2. `app/api/scan/route.ts` - Check limits before scanning
3. `components/ScanForm.tsx` - Show remaining scans
4. `components/UsageIndicator.tsx` - Update to show trial limits

**Schema Changes:**
```prisma
model User {
  // Existing fields...
  trialScansUsed    Int      @default(0)
  trialScansLimit   Int      @default(10)
  freeScansUsed     Int      @default(0)
  freeScansLimit    Int      @default(5)
}
```

**Logic:**
```typescript
async function checkScanLimit(user) {
  if (user.subscription === 'free') {
    if (user.freeScansUsed >= user.freeScansLimit) {
      throw new Error('Free scan limit reached');
    }
  } else if (isTrialUser(user)) {
    if (user.trialScansUsed >= user.trialScansLimit) {
      throw new Error('Trial scan limit reached');
    }
  }
  // Pro users: check daily limit (existing logic)
}
```

### Task 3: Navigation & Responsiveness Fixes

**Issue:** Pages not properly connected, buttons don't redirect correctly

**Files to Audit & Fix:**

1. **Landing Page → Pricing**
   - File: `app/landingpage.tsx`
   - Fix: Ensure all CTA buttons link to `/pricing`

2. **Pricing → Dashboard (after upgrade)**
   - File: `app/pricing/page.tsx`
   - Fix: Redirect to dashboard after successful Stripe checkout

3. **Dashboard → Settings**
   - File: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
   - Fix: Settings link in navigation

4. **Settings → Billing**
   - File: `app/settings/page.tsx`
   - Fix: "Manage Subscription" button

5. **Upgrade Modals → Pricing**
   - File: `components/UpgradeModal.tsx`
   - Fix: "Upgrade to Pro" redirects to `/pricing#stripe-pricing-table`

**Navigation Checklist:**
- [ ] All "Start Free Trial" buttons → `/pricing`
- [ ] All "Upgrade to Pro" buttons → `/pricing`
- [ ] All "View Report" links → `/scan/[id]`
- [ ] All "Dashboard" links → `/dashboard`
- [ ] All "Settings" links → `/settings`
- [ ] All email CTAs → correct URLs with tracking params

### Task 4: Contrast & Accessibility Fixes 🎨

**Issue:** Settings page has poor contrast (bright text on light background)

**Files to Fix:**
1. `app/settings/page.tsx`
2. `components/profile/EnhancedSubscriptionManager.tsx`
3. `components/profile/ProfileForm.tsx`
4. `components/ui/*` - All form components

**Contrast Standards:**
- Minimum: 4.5:1 for normal text
- Minimum: 3:1 for large text (18px+)
- Target: 7:1 for WCAG AAA compliance

**Quick Fixes:**
```tsx
// BEFORE (Bad contrast)
<p className="text-gray-300">Setting description</p>

// AFTER (Good contrast)
<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Setting description</p>

// BEFORE
<label className="text-gray-400">Email Preferences</label>

// AFTER
<label className="text-gray-900 font-medium">Email Preferences</label>
```

**Comprehensive Audit:**
1. Run accessibility scan on `/settings`
2. Fix all contrast violations
3. Test with Chrome DevTools contrast checker
4. Verify WCAG AA compliance minimum

## 🚀 Quick Wins (Can Implement Today)

### 1. Add "Trial" Badge to Dashboard
```tsx
{isTrialUser && (
  <div className="bg-purple-100 border border-purple-300 rounded-lg p-4 mb-6">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <Crown className="h-5 w-5 text-purple-600" />
      <div>
        <p className="font-semibold text-purple-900">
          Pro Trial Active: {daysRemaining} days left
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-purple-700">
          {scansRemaining} scans remaining • Upgrade for unlimited
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### 2. Upgrade Prompt on Export Button
```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => {
    if (isPaidUser) {
      exportPDF();
    } else {
      showUpgradeModal('export');
    }
  }}
  className="..."
>
  {isPaidUser ? 'Export PDF' : 'Upgrade to Export'}
</button>
```

### 3. Trial Scans Counter
```tsx
{isTrialUser && (
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
    Trial scans used: {trialScansUsed}/{trialScansLimit}
  </p>
)}
```

## 📝 Notes

### Best Practices
1. **Be Transparent:** Tell users upfront about trial limits
2. **Show Value:** Let them see full results, just limit exports
3. **Create Urgency:** Countdown timer, scans remaining
4. **Make It Easy:** One-click upgrade from any prompt
5. **Track Everything:** Know what drives conversions

### Avoid
- ❌ Hiding trial limits (feels like bait-and-switch)
- ❌ Making trial too restrictive (can't evaluate properly)
- ❌ Aggressive upselling (ruins user experience)
- ❌ Losing data after trial (keep scan history for paid users)
