## 💡 Notes

### Known Limitations
1. **Database Connection:** Supabase database currently unreachable (paused/down)
   - Solution: Reactivate Supabase or connect to alternative PostgreSQL
   
2. **Scheduled Scans:** Feature commented out (ScheduledScan model not in schema)
   - Solution: Add ScheduledScan model to schema.prisma when ready to implement

3. **API Keys:** apiKey field referenced in code but not in schema
   - Solution: Either add apiKey field or remove unused API key management code

### Recommendations
1. **Test with real users:** Conduct user testing sessions
2. **Monitor errors:** Set up Sentry error tracking
3. **A/B testing:** Test different email subject lines and modal copy
4. **Analytics:** Track user behavior through trial funnel
5. **Feedback loop:** Collect and act on user feedback weekly
