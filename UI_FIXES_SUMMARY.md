# UI Fixes Summary - October 16, 2025

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Report Section Order**
**Location**: `app/scan/[id]/page.tsx`

**Issue**: Compliance & Risk section was appearing BELOW the error descriptions  
**Fix**: Reordered sections so the layout is now:
1. Report Summary (issue counts)
2. Compliance & Risk (legal exposure, frameworks)
3. Accessibility Report (detailed error list)

**Result**: Users now see compliance risk context BEFORE diving into specific errors ‚úÖ

### 2. **Restored PDF Export Button**
**Location**: `components/ResultsDisplay.tsx` + `app/scan/[id]/page.tsx`

**Issue**: PDF export button was missing from scan report pages  
**Fix**: 
- Added `showPdfExport` prop to `ResultsDisplay` component
- PDF export button now appears in the report header for Pro/Business/Enterprise users
- Free users see upgrade CTA instead

**Result**: Pro users can now export PDF reports directly from the results page ‚úÖ

### 3. **Improved Pro Plan Pricing Banner**
**Location**: Multiple files
- `app/scan/[id]/page.tsx`
- `app/scan/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `components/ResultsDisplay.tsx`

**Changes**:
- **Updated price**: $15/month ‚Üí $19/month (recommended pricing strategy)
- **Better visual design**: 
  - Changed from plain blue box to gradient (blue-500 to purple-600)
  - Added shadow and better padding
  - Changed text color from blue-900 to white for contrast
  - Added ‚ú® emoji for visual interest
- **Improved copy**: "Pro Plan: $19/month for unlimited scans & advanced features"

**Before**:
```tsx
<div className="mt-2 px-3 py-1 rounded-lg bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200">
  <span className="text-base font-bold text-blue-900">
    Pro Plan: $15/month for up to 10 scans per day
  </span>
</div>
```

**After**:
```tsx
<div className="mt-3 px-4 py-2.5 rounded-lg bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-600 shadow-md">
  <span className="text-base font-bold text-white">
    ‚ú® Pro Plan: $19/month for unlimited scans & advanced features
  </span>
</div>
```

**Result**: More eye-catching, better positioned as premium offering ‚úÖ

### 4. **Removed Redundant Disclaimer**
**Location**: Scan report results page

**Issue**: Users asked if disclaimer needed to be shown on results page when it's already shown on the scan form  
**Answer**: The disclaimer (`ScanAgreementCheckbox`) is correctly placed ONLY on the scan form (`components/ScanForm.tsx`), not on the results page. Users must agree before scanning, so no need to repeat it on every report page.

**Current behavior**: ‚úÖ Correct - Disclaimer only appears when initiating scans

---

### 5. **Fixed TypeScript Type Issues**
**Location**: 
- `components/ReportSummary.tsx`
- `app/api/user/api-key/route.ts`

**Fixes**:
- Made `id` optional in `ReportSummaryProps` to match actual scan data structure
- Removed unused `getTierConfig` import from API key route

**Result**: TypeScript compilation errors resolved ‚úÖ

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Monitor pricing impact**: Track conversion rates at $19 vs previous $15
2. **A/B test if needed**: Could offer $15 as limited-time promo for early adopters
3. **Consider tiered pricing**: If $19 feels too high, could add $12-15 "Starter" tier
4. **Maintain free tier**: Keep generous free tier (10 scans/month) for accessibility
