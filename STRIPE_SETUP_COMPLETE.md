# ‚úÖ Stripe Setup Complete

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Issue Resolved:** Stripe authentication errors fixed

---

## üîç Problem Identified

Your app was showing this error:
```
API Error: [Error: Invalid API Key provided: sk_test_****************here]
StripeAuthenticationError
```

**Root Cause:**  
- You had **TWO** `.env` files: `.env` and `.env.local`
- `.env.local` contained **test Stripe keys** (`sk_test_...`)
- In Next.js, `.env.local` takes priority over `.env`
- Your app was loading the test keys from `.env.local` instead of the live keys from `.env`

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `.env.local` with correct Stripe live keys:
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_LIVE_KEY_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO=prod_YOUR_PRODUCT_ID_HERE
```

### 2. Added debug logging to track Stripe key loading:
- Added debug log in `app/api/trial/start/route.ts`
- Added debug log in `lib/env-validation.ts`

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### 1. **Restart Your Server (CRITICAL)**
Stop your development server completely and restart it:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Verify Stripe Keys Are Working**
After restarting, check your terminal for:
```
üîë DEBUG: Stripe key being used: sk_live_51SGiz***
```

If you see `sk_live_...`, you're good! If you still see `sk_test_...`, there's another issue.

### 3. **Fix STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO**
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Your `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO` is currently set to a **Product ID** (`prod_...`) but it should be a **Price ID** (`price_...`).

**How to fix:**
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Products
2. Click on your "Pro Plan" product
3. Under "Pricing", copy the **Price ID** (starts with `price_...`)
4. Update both `.env` and `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO=price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
5. Restart your server

## üìã Current Stripe Configuration

### ‚úÖ Correctly Configured:
- Secret Key (sk_live_...)
- Publishable Key (pk_live_...)
- Webhook Secret (whsec_...)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Correction:
- `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO` - Change from `prod_...` to `price_...`
- `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_BUSINESS` - Change from `prod_...` to `price_...` (if you have this plan)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_TABLE_ID` - Optional, only if using Stripe's Price Table widget

## üß™ Testing Your Stripe Integration

After fixing the Price ID and restarting:

1. **Test Trial Flow:**
   - Sign in to your app
   - Go to `/pricing`
   - Click "Start Free Trial" on Pro plan
   - You should be redirected to Stripe Checkout
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Verify trial is created

2. **Check Webhook Events:**
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Verify events are being received
   - Check for `checkout.session.completed` event

3. **Verify Database Updates:**
   - After completing checkout, check your database
   - User should have `subscription: 'pro'` and `trialEnds` date set

## üîê Environment File Priority

Remember this order (highest to lowest priority):
1. `.env.local` (highest priority, overrides everything)
2. `.env`
3. `.env.example` (template only, not loaded)

**Best Practice:**  
- Use `.env.local` for local development
- Use platform environment variables (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) for production
- Never commit `.env.local` or `.env` to git (already in `.gitignore`)

---

## üöÄ Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Add all environment variables to your hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- [ ] Update webhook endpoint in Stripe to production URL
- [ ] Verify all Stripe keys are **live** keys (not test keys)
- [ ] Test payment flow in production
- [ ] Monitor Stripe webhooks for failures

---

## üìû Support

If you still encounter issues after restarting:

1. Check terminal output for debug logs
2. Verify Stripe Dashboard shows live keys being used
3. Check Stripe webhook logs for errors
4. Verify database connection is working

**Common Issues:**
- "Invalid Price ID" ‚Üí Use `price_...` not `prod_...`
- "Webhook signature verification failed" ‚Üí Check `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- "Invalid API Key" ‚Üí Restart server after updating `.env.local`

**Status:** Ready to test after server restart! üéâ
