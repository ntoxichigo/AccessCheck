# ‚úÖ Email System - Final Setup Steps

## What's Done:
- ‚úÖ DNS records added to IONOS (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- ‚úÖ Resend API key added to .env.local
- ‚úÖ Email templates created (welcome, trial reminders)
- ‚úÖ Test endpoint ready
- ‚úÖ Webhook handler created

---

## üöÄ What You Need to Do Now:

### Step 1: Wait for DNS Propagation (24-48 hours)
Your DNS records need time to propagate. You can check status:
- Go to https://resend.com/domains
- Click on `accesscheck.pro`
- Wait for status to change to "Verified" ‚úÖ

**While waiting, you can still test with verified email addresses in Resend.**

---

### Step 2: Test Email Sending (Do This Now!)

#### **Option A: Browser Test (Quick)**
1. Open `app/api/test-email/route.ts`
2. Change line 12 to your email:
   ```typescript
   to: 'your.email@example.com', // Replace with your actual email
   ```
3. Save file
4. Make sure dev server is running: `npm run dev`
5. Open browser: http://localhost:3000/api/test-email
6. Check your inbox for welcome email!

#### **Option B: Terminal Test**
Run this in PowerShell:
```powershell
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-email
```

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Welcome email sent successfully!",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

### Step 3: Set Up Clerk Webhook (For Automatic Emails)

This makes emails send automatically when users sign up or start trials.

#### **3.1: Get Webhook URL**
Your webhook endpoint is already created at:
```
https://accesscheck.pro/api/webhooks/clerk
```

For **local testing**, use ngrok:
```powershell
ngrok http 3000
```
Then use: `https://YOUR_NGROK_URL.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/clerk`

#### **3.2: Add Webhook in Clerk Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Select your AccessCheck project
3. Click **"Webhooks"** in left sidebar
4. Click **"Add Endpoint"**
5. Fill in:
   - **Endpoint URL:** `https://accesscheck.pro/api/webhooks/clerk`
   - **Events:** Check these boxes:
     - ‚úÖ `user.created`
     - ‚úÖ `user.updated`
6. Click **"Create"**
7. Copy the **"Signing Secret"** (starts with `whsec_`)

#### **3.3: Add Webhook Secret to .env.local**
1. Open `.env.local`
2. Find line: `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE`
3. Replace with your actual secret
4. Save file
5. **Restart dev server** for changes to take effect

### Step 4: Verify Email Addresses in Resend (Optional)

Until your domain is verified, you can only send emails TO verified addresses.

1. Go to https://resend.com/emails or "Verified Addresses"
2. Add your test email addresses
3. Check inbox and click verification links
4. Now you can send test emails to those addresses

**After domain verification, you can send to ANY email address.**
