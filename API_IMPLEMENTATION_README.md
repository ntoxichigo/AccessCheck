## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps, 15 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run Migration
```powershell
cd c:\Users\anton\OneDrive\Desktop\AccessCheck-main\accessibility-checker
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_api_rate_limiting
```

### Step 2: Regenerate Prisma Client

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
```sql
-- New fields on User table
apiKeysLimit       → How many keys user can create
apiRequestsLimit   → Monthly API request limit
apiRequestsUsed    → Current usage counter
billingCycleStart  → When to reset counter

-- New fields on ApiKey table
requestsUsed       → Per-key usage tracking

-- New table
ApiUsageLog        → Complete audit trail
```

### Core Functions
```typescript
// lib/api/rateLimiter.ts
getTierConfig(subscription)      → Get limits for tier
canCreateApiKey(userId)          → Check creation limit
checkRateLimit(apiKey)           → Validate request
incrementUsage(...)              → Track usage
getUsageStats(userId)            → Dashboard metrics
```

### API Routes
```typescript
// app/api/user/api-key/route.ts
GET    /api/user/api-key         → List keys + usage stats
POST   /api/user/api-key         → Create new key (tier-gated)
DELETE /api/user/api-key?keyId=  → Revoke key
```

## 📊 Revenue Projections

### Conservative (Year 1)
- 100 Free users → 2% convert = 2 Pro users
- **MRR**: $38/month
- **ARR**: ~$2,000

### Optimistic (Year 1)
- 500 Free users → 5% convert = 25 Pro users
- 25 Pro → 10% upgrade = 2-3 Business users
- 1 Enterprise customer
- **MRR**: ~$1,223/month
- **ARR**: ~$15,000

### Break-even
- ~3-4 Pro subscribers covers all fixed costs

## 🎯 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Timeframe |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Free → Pro conversion | 2-5% | Month 1-3 |
| Pro → Business upgrade | 5-10% | Month 3-6 |
| Churn rate | <5% | Ongoing |
| API usage (% of limit) | 60-80% | Ongoing |
| CAC vs LTV ratio | 1:3+ | Year 1 |

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Temporary)

### TypeScript Errors in `rateLimiter.ts`
**Status**: Expected, will auto-resolve  
**Solution**: Run `npx prisma generate` after migration  
**Why**: Prisma client needs regeneration with new schema fields

---

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **API Key Hashing**: Keys stored as hashed values, never plain text
2. **Key Isolation**: Each key tracked independently for security
3. **Easy Revocation**: One-click key deactivation
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete log of all API requests
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DDoS
6. **Tier Enforcement**: Backend validation of subscription status

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### Why gate API for Pro users only?
- Industry standard (competitors do the same)
- Clear value differentiation
- Revenue driver
- Prevents abuse

### Why 1,000 requests/month for Pro?
- Competitive pricing ($19 vs $49+ competitors)
- Sufficient for individuals
- Creates natural upgrade path to Business
- Covers infrastructure costs

### Why monthly reset vs rolling window?
- Simpler to understand
- Aligns with billing cycle
- Easier to implement
- More predictable for users
