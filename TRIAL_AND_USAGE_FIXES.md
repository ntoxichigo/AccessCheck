# Trial System & Usage Display Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Trial Banner Updated (3 Days + Stripe Redirect)
**Problem**: 
- Banner showed "14-day trial" instead of 3 days
- Clicking "Start Trial" showed "[object Object]" instead of redirecting to Stripe

**Solution**:
- Updated text: "Start Your Free 3-Day Pro Trial"
- Updated subtitle: "Enter payment info • Auto-charges $19/month after trial • Cancel anytime"
- Fixed button handler to redirect to Stripe Checkout URL from API response:
```typescript
if (response.ok && data.checkoutUrl) {
  window.location.href = data.checkoutUrl;
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `components/TrialBanner.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Usage Indicator Always Visible
**Problem**: 
- Scan usage only showed after clicking scan button
- Users couldn't track their daily limit proactively

**Solution**:
- Added `UsageIndicator` component to `/scan` page
- Fetches usage data on page load via `/api/usage`
- Shows: "0 / 1 scans used (today)" for free users
- Updates in real-time after scanning

**Files Modified**:
- `app/scan/page.tsx` - Added usage fetch and display

### 3. ✅ Upgrade Modal Improvements
**Problem**: 
- Modal showed inconsistent pricing ($15 vs $19)
- Scan limit message unclear

**Solution**:
- Updated scan limit subtitle to clearly show: "You've used X out of Y daily scans"
- Added note: "Free users get 1 scan per day. Upgrade for more!"
- Fixed pricing to consistently show $19/month
- Updated benefits list to include all Pro features

**Files Modified**:
- `components/UpgradeModal.tsx`
