**Action Required:**
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

- ⚠️ Some third-party widgets may have issues

**Browser Testing:**
```

⚠️ Internet Explorer 11 (deprecated, not tested)
```

**Screen Reader Testing:**
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### ARIA Usage
```tsx
// ✅ Good ARIA examples in codebase:
<button aria-label="Close modal" aria-expanded={isOpen}>
<nav aria-label="Main navigation">
<div role="alert" aria-live="polite">
<img src="..." alt="Descriptive text">

// ⚠️ Needs improvement:
- Some decorative images missing aria-hidden
- Some emoji need aria-hidden
- Complex widgets need more ARIA states
```

### Focus Management
```tsx
// ✅ Implemented:
- Focus indicators with ring-2 ring-blue-500
- Logical tab order
- Focus trapped in modals

// ⚠️ Needs improvement:
- Focus restoration after modal close
- Skip link to main content
- Focus announcement for dynamic content
```

### Semantic HTML
```tsx
// ✅ Using:
<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, <article>, <section>
<h1> - <h6> hierarchy
<button> for actions, <a> for navigation
<form>, <label>, <input> properly associated

// ⚠️ Could improve:
- Some divs could be semantic elements
- More descriptive heading text
```
