2. **Environment Variables** - App will crash
3. **Production Stripe Keys** - Test keys won't work
4. **Database Migration** - Data won't persist
5. **NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL** - Redirects will fail

## üìù Notes

- All critical functionality implemented and tested
- Environment validation will prevent startup if vars missing
- Stripe webhooks sync subscriptions automatically
- Export features available for Pro+ users
